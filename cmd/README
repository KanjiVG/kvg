FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY

* kvg-mode.el provides an Emacs editing mode which automatically
renumbers all the XML elements for consistency, and indents the buffer
each time the file is saved (C-x C-s). It requires the user already
has go-mode.el installed. It also uses a hard-coded path for renumber,
so it will require end-user editing to be used correctly.

* Makefile builds the two Go binaries.

* read-write-test.go provides a utility which reads and then writes
back out all the files of kvg, and prints a report on which files
differ from the standard formatting.

* renumber provides a utility which reformats and renumbers the files
provided on the command line. This is used by the Emacs editing mode.
